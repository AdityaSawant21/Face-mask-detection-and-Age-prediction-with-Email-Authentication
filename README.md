# Face mask detection and age prediction with Email Authentication using Deep Learning.

Problem: Today Face Mask has become compulsory for all the people in the world, But, some people due to their negligence of not wearing the mask, making the situation severe. So, checking everyone 24hrs in an organization is a bit tedious task. So there comes a Automated Face Mask detection system and age prediction with Email Authentication which is built using the Deep Learning technique called as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This CNN Model is built using the TensorFlow framework and the OpenCV library which is highly used for real-time applications.

### TECH/FRAMEWORK USED:
- OPENCV
- TENSORFLOW
- Tkinter
- KERAS
- MOBILE NET V2
- Xampp Server

Objective: To Make a LIVE_STREAM MASK DETECTION SYSTEM where it detects and recognizes the face and warns that person to wear a mask and also send mail alerts to the admin when it finds someone without mask.
